# Fitness Studio Global Workout Analysis

## Project Overview

As a product manager for a fitness studio, I am interested in understanding the current demand for digital fitness classes and identifying potential areas for growth of digital products and services. To achieve this, I plan to conduct a market analysis in Python using data from Google Trends keyword searches related to fitness and related products. This is a Datacamp Project

The data is provided in several CSV files located in the "Files/data" folder, which offer international and national-level data on various fitness-related keywords. The files include:

1. **workout.csv**: Contains the worldwide popularity index of the keyword 'workout' over time.
2. **three_keywords.csv**: Contains the worldwide popularity indices of the keywords 'home workout', 'gym workout', and 'home gym' over time.
3. **workout_geo.csv**: Contains the popularity indices of the keyword 'workout' in various countries over a 5-year period.
4. **three_keywords_geo.csv**: Contains the popularity indices of the keywords 'home workout', 'gym workout', and 'home gym' in various countries over a 5-year period.

## Key Findings

1. **Global Peak Search Interest for 'Workout'**:
   - The year of peak global search interest for the keyword 'workout' is `year_str`.

2. **Most Popular Workout Keywords**:
   - The most popular workout-related keyword during the COVID-19 pandemic was `peak_covid`.
   - The most popular workout-related keyword currently is `current`.

3. **Country with Highest Workout Interest**:
   - Among the United States, Australia, and Japan, the country with the highest interest for workouts is `top_country`.

4. **Country with Highest Home Workout Interest**:
   - Between the Philippines and Malaysia, the country with the highest interest in home workouts is `home_workout_geo`.

## Data and Methodology

The analysis is based on data from various sources, including Google Trends and other publicly available datasets. The queries and analysis are performed using Python, with the help of libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the global and national trends in workout interest, which can help the fitness studio make informed decisions about their product offerings and marketing strategies. The findings can be used to identify the most promising markets for their virtual home workout services and to tailor their content and promotions to the preferences of their target audience.
